## How to enable VSCode IntelliSense for Zephyr RTOS

To enable IntelliSense for Zephyr RTOS in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. **Open the project in Visual Studio Code.**

2. **Create a `.vscode` folder in the root of the project.**

3. **Create a `settings.json` file in the `.vscode` folder.**

4. **Fill the `settings.json` file with the following content:**

    ```json
    {
        "C_Cpp.default.compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/compile_commands.json",
        "files.associations": {},
    }
    ```

5. **Save the file and rebuild the project. IntelliSense should now work in Visual Studio Code.**

## Troubleshooting

### Constant Reboot After Flashing

If the board continuously resets after flashing and displays the following message:

```textplain
I (49) soc_init: ESP Simple boot
I (49) soc_init: compile time Dec 18 2024 20:25:25
W (49) soc_init: Unicore bootloader
I (50) spi_flash: detected chip: generic
I (54) spi_flash: flash io: dio
I (57) soc_init: chip revision: v1.0
E (60) soc_init: You are using ESP32 chip revision (1) that is unsupported. While it may work, it could cause unexpected behavior or issues.
E (73) soc_init: Proceeding with this ESP32 chip revision is not recommended unless you fully understand the potential risk and limitations.
E (85) soc_init: If you choose to continue, please enable the 'CONFIG_ESP32_USE_UNSUPPORTED_REVISION' in your project configuration.
E (97) boot: HW init failed, aborting
Fatal exception (0): IllegalInstruction
epc1=0x400d1422, epc2=0x00000000, epc3=0x00000000, excvaddr=0x00000000, depc=0x00000000
```

This indicates the ESP32 chip revision is unsupported. For older revisions, such as `ESP32-D0WDQ6 (revision v1.0)`, enable support by adding the following line to the `boards/esp32_devkitc_wroom.conf` or `prj.conf` file:

```kconfig
CONFIG_ESP32_USE_UNSUPPORTED_REVISION=y
```

Rebuild and flash the project after making this change.
